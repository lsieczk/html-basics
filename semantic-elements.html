  <h1>My Favorite Superheroes: A Semantic Webpage</h1>
  <h2>DC heroes</h2>
  <p><em>DC superhero comics are the best.</em><br>
    The storylines are more complex, and <u>often address real life social issues.</u> My favorite is <strong>Green Arrow.</strong></p>

  <h3><small>Marvel heroes or whatever</small></h3>
  <p><q>Marvel superhero comics feel more 2-dimensional.</q> However, Marvel is really killing it in the film and TV industries, whereas DC's attempts to capitalize on the TV and film industries are more mediocre.</p>
  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>But they do have decent movies and TV shows for whatever that's worth.</p>
  <blockquote>To summarize, Marvel heroes are not as cool as DC heroes.</blockquote>
